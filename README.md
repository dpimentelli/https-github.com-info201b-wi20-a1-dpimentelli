# "Serena is a Title Winner Again"
Over the weekend, Serena Williams won her **73rd WTA title** at the _ASB Classic_ in Auckland. Her last title was in 2017, when she was pregnant with her first child, Olympia. This win gives her momentum going into the first grand slam of the year in two weeks in `Melbourne, Australia`. While this victory is celebratory, the bush fires the continent and communities are experiencing are `detrimental`. In her awards speech Williams said,
> So I decided at the beginning of the tournament every match I played I'd donate a dress and I'd also donate all my prize money for a great cause.**.

 Williams has proved herself as a _strong and philanthropic person_.
